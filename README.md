# Astar-Game
based on the tile-based game and A* algorithm from Daniel Bonham's (bonhamdaniel) AstarPathfinding repositiory: https://github.com/bonhamdaniel/AStarPathfinding

Java tile-based game that randomly generates a board of variously colored tiles for the user to navigate.
User is to click on a path from the blue tile to the green tile with the least cost. Yellow tiles have a cost of 1, red tiles have a cost of 3, and purple tiles have a cost of 4. Clicking the randomize button creates a new randomly-generated board and clears the cost count. Clicking on the execute button uses the A* algorithm to display the optimal cost-effective route.
